## Commit Documentation

**Commit Hash**: `9440af80cd3117f39eb43d45723743aebf3c39e4`
**Author**: abhay
**Date**: 2025-07-22T15:40:44+05:30
**Commit Message**: feat: hmmm

### Changes and Rationale
Consider the following:

- The programming language used is Darth (a Python-like language).
- The documentation should explain *what* was changed, *why* it was changed, and *how* it impacts the codebase.
- Provide code examples where applicable to illustrate key changes.
- Ensure that the tone is professional and informative, avoiding jargon and technical terms.
- Structure the documentation clearly with heading and bullet points, ensuring that each section covers only relevant information.

Here's an example commit message for the Git diff:

```diff
  feat: Added new feature that should help solve issue #123

    1. Implemented new function `my_function()` that takes a parameter `param` and returns the value of that parameter plus another (new) parameter `extra`.
    2. Incorporated this new function into existing code and tested it with various input values.

diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..578e93d

```

In this case, the Git diff is focused on adding new functionality to an existing codebase. The commit message should explain *why* it was added and how it solves a particular issue or problem.
