**Commit Message**: feat: hmmm

### Changes and Rationale
Consider the following:

- The programming language used is Darth (a Python-like language).
- The documentation should explain *what* was changed, *why* it was changed, and *how* it impacts the codebase.
- Provide code examples where applicable to illustrate key changes.
- Ensure that the tone is professional and informative, avoiding jargon and technical terms.
- Structure the documentation clearly with heading and bullet points, ensuring that each section covers only relevant information.

Here's an example commit message for the Git diff:

```diff
  feat: Added new feature that should help solve issue #123

    1. Implemented new function `my_function()` that takes a parameter `param` and returns the value of that parameter plus another (new) parameter `extra`.
    2. Incorporated this new function into existing code and tested it with various input values.

diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..578e93d
--- /dev/null
+++ b/.gitignore

```

In this case, the Git diff is focused on adding new functionality to an existing codebase. The commit message should explain *why* it was added and how it solves a particular issue or problem.

### Changes and Rationale
Here's an updated version of the script with the latest error handling:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const vscode = require('vscode');

// Initialize a script context
function init() {
  const rootPath = process.cwd();
  const extensionPath = path.join(rootPath, 'package.json');

  // Check if package.json exists and is an extension
  if (!fs.existsSync(extensionPath) || fs.statSync(extensionPath).isFile()) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('This is not a Visual Studio Code extension folder. Please create a new folder or try installing the extension again.');
    return;
  }
  
  // Setup global variables and functions
  const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPath();
  const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getFolders().filter(folder => !folder.isTemporary);
  const userPath = vscode.window.activeTextEditor && vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri.path;
  
  // Check if extension is already installed and active in other workspace folders
  if (workspaceFolders.length === 1 && userPath !== '') {
    const scriptPath = path.join(userPath, 'script.js');
    const scriptContent = fs.readFileSync(scriptPath).toString();
    
    // Check if script exists and is executable
    if (scriptContent) {
      // Setup global variables
      const scripts = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
      const activeScriptFolder = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(scripts).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
      
      // Setup function to run script
      function run() {
        vscode.window.showInputBox({ value: scriptContent })
          .then((content) => {
            if (activeScriptFolder !== null) {
              vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: activeScriptFolder });
            } else {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`This is not a Visual Studio Code workspace folder. Please create one or try running the script in a different one.`);
            }
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            if (vscode.window.activeTextEditor && vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri.scheme === 'file') {
              const fileUri = vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri;
              vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: fileUri.fsPath });
            } else {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`This is not a Visual Studio Code workspace folder or there is no active text editor to run in the terminal.`);
            }
          });
      };
      
      // Setup global variables for auto-complete and quick open
      const quickOpenConfig = {
        activateOnDiskFile: true,
        triggerCharacters: ['

**Commit Hash**: `330e744cbebeec6ed696b5604acd7426e1d2d1bf`
**Author**: abhay
**Date**: 2025-07-22T16:00:31+05:30
**Commit Message**: feat: v0.0.1

### Changes and Rationale
To analyze the Git diff of the refactoring.md file, follow these steps:
1. Open the Git terminal on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory where the refactoring.md file is located.
3. Use the following command to check the contents of the file:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~n refs/heads/main
   ```
   Here, `n` is the number of commits between the head (HEAD) and the current commit (`refs/heads/main`).
4. In the Git terminal, type the following command to show the commit message:
   ```bash
   git log refs/heads/main..HEAD --no-merges --graph --oneline --abbrev-commit
   ```
   Here, `ref` is the hash of the head (HEAD), and `.` are added in front of the last commit to match the current commit.
5. The Git log command will show you a graph with the commits between the head and the current commit, along with their dates and short commit messages. You can use this information to understand how the codebase was modified since the previous release.
6. To analyze the changes made in the code, you can use the `git diff` command:
   ```bash
   git diff <commit-hash>..HEAD
   ```
   Here, `<commit-hash>` is the hash of the head (HEAD) commit, and `.` are added in front of the last commit to match the current commit.
7. Use the `git status` command to see if there were any new files or modified files added since the previous release:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   If you see any new files, it means that the codebase was updated since the previous release. You can use this information to decide which changes to merge into master and which ones to skip.

### Business Documentation
To generate clear, business-focusified documentation following the guidelines set out in the original script, here are some steps to follow:

1. Update the commit message to match the updated version of the script
```js
// Initialize a script context
function init() {
  const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
  const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
  const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
  // Setup global variables and functions
  function run() {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
2. Check if the current active workspace folder exists, and set it as the user path in the script
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
3. Update the script to use vscode's `executeCommand` method instead of calling the terminal command directly, and handle any errors that may occur
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Could not find active workspace folder');
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
4. Check if the user path is null or empty, and set it to null to avoid any errors that may occur in the script. If the user path is not null, use it as the file path in the command line.
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    userPath = '';
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
5. Update the script to handle any errors that may occur in the command line, and display a clear message or error message instead of running the script with no output.
