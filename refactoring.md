**Commit Message**: feat: hmmm

### Changes and Rationale
Consider the following:

- The programming language used is Darth (a Python-like language).
- The documentation should explain *what* was changed, *why* it was changed, and *how* it impacts the codebase.
- Provide code examples where applicable to illustrate key changes.
- Ensure that the tone is professional and informative, avoiding jargon and technical terms.
- Structure the documentation clearly with heading and bullet points, ensuring that each section covers only relevant information.

Here's an example commit message for the Git diff:

```diff
  feat: Added new feature that should help solve issue #123

    1. Implemented new function `my_function()` that takes a parameter `param` and returns the value of that parameter plus another (new) parameter `extra`.
    2. Incorporated this new function into existing code and tested it with various input values.

diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..578e93d
--- /dev/null
+++ b/.gitignore
@@ -0,0 +1,24 @@
+# Node modules

```

In this case, the Git diff is focused on adding new functionality to an existing codebase. The commit message should explain *why* it was added and how it solves a particular issue or problem.

### Changes and Rationale
Here's an updated version of the script with the latest error handling:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const vscode = require('vscode');

// Initialize a script context
function init() {
  const rootPath = process.cwd();
  const extensionPath = path.join(rootPath, 'package.json');

  // Check if package.json exists and is an extension
  if (!fs.existsSync(extensionPath) || fs.statSync(extensionPath).isFile()) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('This is not a Visual Studio Code extension folder. Please create a new folder or try installing the extension again.');
    return;
  }
  
  // Setup global variables and functions
  const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPath();
  const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getFolders().filter(folder => !folder.isTemporary);
  const userPath = vscode.window.activeTextEditor && vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri.path;
  
  // Check if extension is already installed and active in other workspace folders
  if (workspaceFolders.length === 1 && userPath !== '') {
    const scriptPath = path.join(userPath, 'script.js');
    const scriptContent = fs.readFileSync(scriptPath).toString();
    
    // Check if script exists and is executable
    if (scriptContent) {
      // Setup global variables
      const scripts = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
      const activeScriptFolder = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(scripts).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
      
      // Setup function to run script
      function run() {
        vscode.window.showInputBox({ value: scriptContent })
          .then((content) => {
            if (activeScriptFolder !== null) {
              vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: activeScriptFolder });
            } else {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`This is not a Visual Studio Code workspace folder. Please create one or try running the script in a different one.`);
            }
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            if (vscode.window.activeTextEditor && vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri.scheme === 'file') {
              const fileUri = vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri;
              vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: fileUri.fsPath });
            } else {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`This is not a Visual Studio Code workspace folder or there is no active text editor to run in the terminal.`);
            }
          });
      };

**Commit Message**: feat: v0.0.1

### Changes and Rationale
To analyze the Git diff of the refactoring.md file, follow these steps:
1. Open the Git terminal on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory where the refactoring.md file is located.
3. Use the following command to check the contents of the file:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~n refs/heads/main
   ```
   Here, `n` is the number of commits between the head (HEAD) and the current commit (`refs/heads/main`).
4. In the Git terminal, type the following command to show the commit message:
   ```bash
   git log refs/heads/main..HEAD --no-merges --graph --oneline --abbrev-commit
   ```
   Here, `ref` is the hash of the head (HEAD), and `.` are added in front of the last commit to match the current commit.
5. The Git log command will show you a graph with the commits between the head and the current commit, along with their dates and short commit messages. You can use this information to understand how the codebase was modified since the previous release.
6. To analyze the changes made in the code, you can use the `git diff` command:
   ```bash
   git diff <commit-hash>..HEAD
   ```
   Here, `<commit-hash>` is the hash of the head (HEAD) commit, and `.` are added in front of the last commit to match the current commit.
7. Use the `git status` command to see if there were any new files or modified files added since the previous release:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   If you see any new files, it means that the codebase was updated since the previous release. You can use this information to decide which changes to merge into master and which ones to skip.

### Business Documentation
To generate clear, business-focusified documentation following the guidelines set out in the original script, here are some steps to follow:

1. Update the commit message to match the updated version of the script
```js
// Initialize a script context
function init() {
  const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
  const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
  const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
  // Setup global variables and functions
  function run() {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
2. Check if the current active workspace folder exists, and set it as the user path in the script
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
3. Update the script to use vscode's `executeCommand` method instead of calling the terminal command directly, and handle any errors that may occur
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Could not find active workspace folder');
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
4. Check if the user path is null or empty, and set it to null to avoid any errors that may occur in the script. If the user path is not null, use it as the file path in the command line.
```js
// Setup global variables
const activeWorkspaceFolder = vscode.workscape.getGlobalPath();
const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.getGlobalPaths().filter(path => path !== activeWorkspaceFolder);
const userPath = vscode.workspace.findActiveFile(workscape.findActiveFile(workscape)).then(file => file && file.uri.fsPath || null);
  
// Setup global variables and functions
function run() {
  if (userPath === null) {
    userPath = '';
  } else {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.runInTerminal', { filePath: userPath });
  }
}
```
5. Update the script to handle any errors that may occur in the command line, and display a clear message or error message instead of running the script with no output.

## Commit: ebc31ffb

**Author:** abhay  
**Date:** 2025-07-23T09:50:57+05:30  
**Message:** feat: optmized how we get the diff

### Feature: Optimized Diff Extraction from Commits in GitDocTool
**What Changed:** Introduction of a new function `get_structured_commit_changes` that efficiently extracts detailed code changes for commits. This includes file paths, status (added/modified/deleted), programming languages used, and specific changed functions or classes with diff hunks to understand the impact better on structural level in the Python scripts of GitDocTool.
**Business Impact:** Developers will have a clearer insight into what has been altered within each commit, allowing for more informed merges and reviews that minimize disru0rbenefit from changes due to merge conflicts or unintended modifications. This should streamline the development workflow by providing structured insights directly related to business-critical code components (e.g., API endpoints).
**Technical Details:**
- Key Implementation Changes: New function `get_structured_commit_changes` added that retrieves detailed change information grouped by programming language used in the project, focusing on file paths and specific modifications to functions or classes within those files. It considers both parent commits (for historical changes) for better context understanding and allows limiting output based on number of changed files/hunks per path (`file_limit` & `hunk_limit`) as well as the symbol count in diff hunks (`symbol_limit`).
- Integration Points: This function integrates with existing Git workflow by providing enhanced insights post commit, which can be directly accessed using Python API endpoints generated for this purpose. It also uses previously implemented `run_command` and parsing logic from the tool to retrieve diff data efficiently without duplicating efforts in fetching git history or processing commits manually.
- Breaking Changes/Migration Requirements: As of now, no breaking changes are introduced that affect existing systems directly; however, developers should ensure their understanding as this enhances transparency and reduces manual review time for complex merges due to significant business logic updates. It may introduce new endpoints or public interfaces which interact with the Python scripts' output data structure but currently operates seamlessly within pre-existing infrastructure workflows in GitDocTool without migration requirements, as it extends functionality rather than replacing existing capabilities.
**COMMIT CONTEXT:** Message "feat: optimized how we get the diff" indicates an enhancement to previously available features for better extraction of commit changes focusing on structural impact and granular detail relevant from a developer perspective with clear benefits in code understanding, merge safety, and workflow efficiency.
Files Modified: 1 file (git_doc_tool.py) within the centrim-docgen/src directory containing Python scripts for Git documentation tooling enhancements.

## Commit: 5c8422cd

**Author:** abhay  
**Date:** 2025-07-23T10:01:05+05:30  
**Message:** feat: added query optimizations

### Feature: Optimized Diff Extraction from Commits in GitDocTool
**What Changed:** Introduction of a new function `get_structured_commit_changes` that efficiently extracts detailed code changes for commits, providing focused insights on file paths and specific modifications within the Python scripts. This feature offers developers granular visibility into commit impact at both class/function level and language-specific context in GitDocTool's source files.
**Business Impact:** Enhanced developer experience through structured comprehension of each change, facilitating quicker merges with fewer merge conflicts due to a deeper understanding of what has been altered during the changeset lifecycle within our projectâ€™s Python codebase. Aiming at improved efficiency in development workflow and documentation generation processes without compromising existing system integrity or introducing mandatory migration steps for developers currently leveraging GitDocTool's features.
**Technical Details:** 
- **Key Implementation Changes:** The newly added function `get_structured_commit_changes` parses detailed diff data, grouping alterations by programming language and focusing on specific files or classes/functions within those scripts where changes occur in the centrim project. It supports parameters for controlling output granularity such as file path limits (`file_limit`) and per-hunk symbol count thresholds to manage verbosity (e.g., `symbol_limit`).
- **Integration Points:** This feature complements existing Git workflow by offering improved insights post commit, accessible through enhanced Python API endpoints generated for this purpose without disrupting current infrastructure flows in the documentation tool's operational scope within centrim project. It extends functional capabilities seamlessly alongside pre-existing systems and no migration of external tools or configurations is needed; only an updated understanding among developers to leverage these new features effectively with minimal effort for integration into their workflow routines.
- **COMMIT CONTEXT:** The change, as captured by the message "feat: optimized how we get the diff", signifies a commitment towards better insights and deeper clarity from developer perspectives on code changes that impact business logic or API functionalities directly linked with core workflow processes within centrim project via GitDocTool's Python scripting interfaces. This enhancement aligns closely aligned interests across teams focusing heavily around maintainability, reliability in documentation creation/update cycles and efficient repository management practices for better version control handling strategies against evolving code complexity levels encountered regularly throughout collaborative development lifecycles at centrim project workspace environment domains including multiple team-based engagement areas spanning backend & frontend systems interdependencies under strict DevOps deployment protocols.
- **Files Modified:** 1 file (git_doc_tool.py) within the centrim-docgen/src directory containing Python scripts dedicated to improving Git documentation tooling functionalities across diverse development use cases involving various project languages supported by centralized code repositories managed via git version control mechanisms operating simultaneously alongside complex deployment architecture configurations tailored specifically towards facilitating streamlined processes among developer communities interactively working together within shared centrim-centric team building cultures while ensuring highest quality assurance standards set forth throughout entirety development life cycle phases starting right from initial commit authorizations till finalized deployments across global web environments where end users directly engage through user interfaces produced via customizable template designs based heavily upon project's specific documentation needs addressing core requirements essential for understanding software functionality without unnecessary information overload scenarios potentially hindering productivity & overall satisfaction levels among targeted audienies accessing said digital content materials provided within respective platform hosting realms.
